Task 1:

Upstream settimeofday(2), gettimeofday(2), utimes(2) and lutimes(2).

These system calls are emulated in the bsd-user fork's blitz branch, but not in
the qemu-project branch. Your task is to prepare a series of patches for
upstreaming this code into the qemu-project master branch. Maintain the same
file names in the bsd-user branch. Each implementation of the system call should
be a separate patch, as well as each auxiliary function.

This change will add a new file to the build, so the meson build files should be
updated as a separate patch.

In addition to moving the code, you'll need to document where the code came from
using git blame. However, the history is complicated, so if blame gets back to
the base commit:

you'll need to check the files in the bsd-user-rebase-3.1 branch to see who
wrote things (I didn't write any of this code). For the real project, you may
need to go back to the bsd-user branch as well (if you get back to the first
commit of the rebase branch).

Test Your Changes:

You'll need to grab the test program to test this. You'll also need to create a
jail as described in
https://github.com/qemu-bsd-user/qemu-bsd-user/blob/blitz/BSD-USER.rst However,
for this testing, you don't need to start the jail or install the
qemu-bsd-user-static packages. You will need to create the jail, and make a note
of where the jail's root is.

Next, you'll need to checkout the gsoc-2023 repo from:

% git clone git@github.com:qemu-bsd-user/gsoc-2023.git
% cd gsoc-2023
% setenv ARM_CHROOT /path/to/jail/131armv7	# Whatever poudriere jail -l says it is
% setenv QEMU_BIN ~/git/qemu/00-qemu		# Where you're building upstream qemu
% make test-1
% make run-test-1

Before the updates, qemu-arm will core dump (if new enough, or you are running
the changes I hope to upstream soon) or return -78 (ENOSYS) (if not) when
tracing. After your successful set of patches, all the tests will work. Though
three of them have system calls which won't return success.

Once you have the patches prepared, use 'git publish' available from
https://github.com/stefanha/git-publish . You'll need to create a branch from
'master' to make this eaiser. Be sure to specify '--to qemu-devel@nongnu.org'
and '--cc imp@bsdimp.com' the first time you run it.
